My name is Baljeet kaur.
According to my last name i am done github branching and my review for this tuorial are following

1.Interactive- As per my perception this tutorial seems interactive because It can lure people to join this  tutorial. As this tutorial involves different levels such as introduction sequence which give the knowledge about git commit command and the second level Ramping up, give us knowledge about the next serving of 100% git awesomeness etc. Hence, it is the constitution of numerous level which provide knowledge about different aspects. 
2.Instructions- This tutorial is easy to learn because it divided into few steps. Each step provides information about different aspects in easy ways. 
3.Visualization- As this tutorial involves numerous pictures or graphics therefore, we can say good example of visualization. 
4.Level- It includes two main levels and four sub levels. Moreover, Git hub is free source so anybody can use this tool according to requirement.
However, this tutorial is a good way to learn new things but in case of lengthy coding like in mix bag if user forget any step in this tutorial, then the users must have to review whole tutorial again.

Graphical representation of each steps makes us understand better and we can easily follow along with tutorial.
As, Kaur balijeet state before the interactive side of this website is detailed that any person who don't know anything about coding can understand easily.
Each level designed very attention to details that evry topic gets cover within it,moreover Exercise aftre each level coverd all the topic which we have studied on that module
to be conclude, The major promblem in website UI is that , if start doing exercise and want see content of that module, we have to leave whole website and start doing everything all over.

I am Nirali N Shah. I learned Git & Github tutorial through https://try.github.io 

This tutorial involves immense resourses regarding git & github. What is git and github & defination of repository are explained in easy way. Moreover, all git commands are described in simple way so everyone can understand it and used it for complete his/her projects.

From this materials, i learned how i can set up git & github. The way to clonning the existing repository and make a branch in which i can edit & upload my file to server.

The tutorial assigned to me was to tryGit challenges(1-25). These challenges seems more interasting to me and it helped me alot.

1) Each challenge devided into two parts, first one is instructions and second is implementations. According to that I created a repository in my account and perform all the necessary actions in order to complete it. After completion, the software automatically checked for whether it is completed successfully or not.

2) In order to complete the challenges, instructions are given. It was very clear to understand how the command line arguments works in order to complete different tasks in Git and also The graphical representations were very useful.

Overall, it was a great experience to use such software to learn Git.

I am Rayan Mohammed, the tutorial assigned to me was "Learn Git Branching" This tutorial was highly helpful in understanding Git branching, the tutorials had in-built play functions so that i could try some hands-on on it. This tutorial is squentially set up in 4 steps. In every step you will learn ins and outs of git commits, tips etc. The hands-on exercise is quite user friendly and anybody without a coding background can do it. The only issue i faced was that the tutorial website UI does not allow us to see the content while doing a task, this makes it difficult as we cannot refer to the content to solve the task.

As per my last name, I had to evaluate "tryGit" interactive version. It is very helpful for a beginner as each & every command is beautifully explained using graphics. The first portion is "Learn by reading" to give a brief idea of what Git is & how it is better to use when working on team projects.
The second portion is "Learn by doing" which according to me is better than theoretical explanation as I got to know what is happening in the background whenever I executed a single command. Our knowledge is checked after learning a new command through different levels which perfectly makes us understand what we learnt. Visualization adds to more involvment into the task (otherwise it could have become a boring task:D). Also, "Git-It" provides hands-on tutorial that teaches us to use Git right from our local environment, using commands on real repositories.

The only thing which is quite annoying is whenever we want to access the content of a particular command while attempting the levels, whole tutorial needs to be reviewed.



I am nishil Patel.

I have just completed "trygit" tutorial. as it was the first time that I was accessing the github the tutorial was really helpful, the best part of the tutorial was the first step that allows us to perform instruction with the help of graphics.

learning  and setting up git & github with the instruction provided in the assignment made it easy to learn. I learned how to perform cloning the existing repository and make a branch in which I can edit file to the server.

Hi, I am Harshilkumar Mayurbhai Patel
It was a good experience to learn about GitHub. As it was first time but Implementation of Repository and gain access to it was nice way to Learn. Even, single command tell us all the change made in repository by online or offline mode.

I am Prince Patel
I was assigned "tryGit" challenges. Mainly into two dofferent parts with instructions and implementation on the other part. Given information lead towards the solution, Initially to complete the given tasks i created a repository in my account.
It was also very helpful to workout with Git through graphical representation and working of Command line arguments.
